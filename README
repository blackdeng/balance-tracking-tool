Single User interacts with the tool by entering expenses. Every expense has a date, a description, an amount, and 0 or more tags. Positive numbers indicate income or money earned (e.g., paychecks, gifts received) and negative numbers are expenses (e.g., groceries, clothes).

The tool will allow users to enter and edit expenses, to tag those expenses, and to visualize trends over time.
